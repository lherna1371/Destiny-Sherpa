A simple fireteam creation app and manager tool for the Destiny video game. I am a big fan of the game and worked on this simple app as a fun learning experience. Users can register, create a Fireteam for a game event or join a Fireteam group. Users must request to join a group, if a user is a group 'owener' they must approve others to join. Once in a Fireteam group users can view other members of the group and post comments.
